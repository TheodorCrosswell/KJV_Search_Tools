This static/tiles/ folder is used to hold the tiles for leaflet.js.

The tiles are omitted from the GitHub Repository, because the folder is very large (3-4 GB).

You can download and use the tiles by going to https://huggingface.co/datasets/Theodor-Crosswell/KJV_Similarity,
downloading "tiles_10_layers.zip", extracting the file, and renaming it to replace this folder.
